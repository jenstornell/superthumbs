# Super Thumbs

Give superpowers to your thumbnails!

**The first feature:** You can add a format to automatically convert `png` to `jpg` files.

**[Installation instructions](docs/install.md)**

## Format

Add a format to automatically convert `png` to `jpg` files.

- `quality` is supported by this feature (set to 90 by default).
- `format` as param will override the config `thumbs.format`
- The `png` thumbnail file is not deleted by the conversion process. If you are deleting this plugin, the cached `png` thumbnail file will be used instead.

### As param

```php
echo thumb($page->image(), array('width' => 300, 'quality' => 80, 'format' => 'jpg'));
```

If the file is in `png` format, it will be converted to `jpg`. It will take `quality` into account.

### As config

To format all files as `jpg` you can set this in your `config.php` file.

```php
c::set('thumbs.format', 'jpg');
```
